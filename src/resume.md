## Projects

---
### Blankit

A network automation web application.
Originally I started development of this to assist with configuring a large number of Access Points for a specific project.
It then grew into a multi-tool to cover multiple solutions not covered by Cisco Catalyst Center.
These solutions range from simply providing a platform to store and display Rogue Access Point reports, migrating large numbers of Access Points from one Wireless LAN controller to another, using small groups to minimize coverage loss as they join a new controller.

It is currently only Open-Source for VUMC as an organization, but a full open-source rewrite is underway to support a full Kubernetes and Docker Deployment, and to remove the front-end framework it uses: Streamlit.

### catalysh

---

As a person who loves staying inside the terminal for most of his work, and to get some experience with the Rust programming language, catalysh is a command-line REPL for interacting with Cisco Catalyst Center through it's HTTP API.

It's currently still under development, as there are a lot of functions to map to commands.

It currently supports some show commands, application configuration commands, and comes with command hints with tab auto-completion, all utilizing a rust library called clap_repl.

It is currently fully open-source, and supports all major Operation Systems, Windows, Mac, and most Linux distributions.

The code and more information is available on my Github.

---
### vNavigator

---

This was my first fully finished application.

It is an application available on the Apple App Store for iOS.

It's functionally a PDF manager/viewer, and was originally developed to make it easier to store and reference maps at work, but it also contains the ability to make small edits to PDFs and share them.

It is still available on the Apple App store, and is free, the code is also available on my Github.
