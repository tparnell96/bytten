This was one of my first fully finished applications, written in Swift and using SwiftUI for the user interface, this application runs on Apples iOS platforms.

The primary use case at the time was to provide a simple interface for organizing, viewing, and lightly editing PDF files (Maps were the PDF in mind at the time of development)
