# Catalysh

This is a rust project I like to work on periodically to get some practice with rust.

It's a tool for interacting with a Cisco Catalyst Center Endpoint via HTTP.

The tool utilization is very Cisco-like, in an attempt to make it easier to remember commands (I also have hints included via the library that the REPL runs in.)
