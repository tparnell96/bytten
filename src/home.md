# Welcome!


My name is Kenneth Parnell.

I'm a Network Specialist with a passion for software design and development.

This was put together with the intention of getting some practice with github workflows, and as a more detailed breakdown of some of my professional/personal programming projects.

This is just a basic mdbook site, so the left panel should provide an easy to navigate structure, feel free to check out my blog or star any of my projects on github if you find them interesting.
