## Welcome!

Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Kenneth Parnell.

This was put together with the intention of getting some practice with github workflows, and as a more detailed breakdown of some of my proffesional/personal programming projects.

This is just a basic mdbook site, so the left panel should provide an easy to navigate structure, feel free to check out my blog or star any of my projects on github!
