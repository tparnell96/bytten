# Welcome!


My name is Kenneth Parnell.

I'm a Network Specialist with a passion for software design and development.

This was put together with the intention of getting some practice with github workflows, and as a more detailed breakdown of some of my professional/personal programming projects, along with hosting a copy of my resume in it's most current state.

The resume portion contains a brief overview of some of my projects, the project page itself goes into a more detailed breakdown to show my process on each project, and provides a link to the associated Github repository for checking out the source code and project structure itself.
